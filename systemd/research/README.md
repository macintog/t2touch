# Uninstalled integration candidates

These units are design artifacts for the future mapped-user broker. They are
not copied by `install.sh`, contain no `[Install]` section, and must not be
manually installed or started yet.

See the [broker reference](../../src/README.md#multi-user-policy-and-broker-non-exposed)
for the surrounding components. These units are not part of the supported
installation.

`t2-touchid-user-broker.socket` uses `ListenSequentialPacket=` with
`Accept=yes`, so systemd accepts one connection and passes only that connected
descriptor to a fresh `t2-touchid-user-broker@.service` instance. The socket is
locally connectable by any account because the broker authenticates the kernel
peer and resolves its protected mapping; it never accepts a target UID from the
request. Per-source, global, and trigger limits bound unauthenticated spawning.

The service entry point fixes mutation policy off. Its only commands are
read-only policy preflight and reconciled identity inventory. It owns one
descriptor, returns at most one response, and exits. The service sandbox keeps
only the local Unix/D-Bus and Bridge IPv6 address families, the T2 AKS device,
read-only home access needed for account-generation evidence, and narrowly
writable runtime/mapping lock directories.

Exposure remains gated on all of the following evidence:

1. The running module must match the installed DKMS build.
2. `sudo t2-aks-observe-test` must pass operation `0x06` on the rebuilt module.
3. Existing and Linux-enrolled fingers must still verify independently.
4. The protected mapped-user state must be enabled and fully reconciled.
5. A negative client/PolicyKit test must prove an unmapped or inactive caller
   receives no inventory and cannot activate a keybag.

The first four prerequisites are summarized without identifiers or mutation by:

```sh
sudo t2-touchid-user-broker-gate \
  --acknowledge-two-distinct-fingers-verified-this-boot
```

Exit status zero means only that gate 5 may be staged. This command does not
copy, start, or enable either unit in this directory.

`t2-touchid-user-broker-negative-client.py` is the fixed no-argument client for
gate 5. It is also excluded from the installer. When the units are deliberately
staged, run this client as the chosen unmapped or inactive account. It sends
only `identities/inventory` to the fixed candidate socket and accepts either an
exact `caller-session-denied`/`mapping-or-capability-denied` response containing
no inventory or authority, or a clean peer close without a response. Malformed,
truncated, cross-command, activation-bearing, inventory-bearing, unavailable-
socket, and other denial states fail the test. A passing client result does not
install or authorize the positive mapped-user path.

After those gates pass, the units still require a reviewed installer, rollback
path, socket-path client, and live failure-injection tests before enablement.

## Historical native fprint drop-ins

The enrollment-only and combined identity-management drop-ins record the
earlier staged rollout. The normal installed service now supplies both exact
worker flags, so these files are not installed and must not be overlaid on the
product unit. The read-only enrollment gate remains useful for running the
documented negative and readiness controls; it does not authorize or perform a
mutation.
